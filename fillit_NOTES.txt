Fillit project
--------------

Objective:	Take a file as parameter which contains a list of Tetriminos shapes, validates them, and arranges them
			in order to create the smallest square possible.

			The shapes must each be touching at least one other shape. If there are multiple possibilies for the
			smallest square, the one with the shapes arranged in the upper-left corner must be displayed.

Concepts:	Structs
			2D arrays
			Algorithm:	Recursive backtracking
						Time optimization


Research:	Tetrimino shapes

			Dancing links algorithm

General approach:
	1) read file
	2) validate file contains valid shapes only
		a. return error if invalid
	3) create a struct array for the shapes to describe their:
		- height
		- width
		- "type"
